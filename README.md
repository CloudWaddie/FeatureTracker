# Feature Tracker
Realtime tracking of features added to AI apps!

This is still a work in progress. I am currently working on making documentation in the form of READMEs for most of this.

Pretty much half of the frontend was coded by Gemini 2.5 Pro. But 99% of the backend was made by me, with AI used for some tedious tasks.

To setup, copy and modify the example .env files.
